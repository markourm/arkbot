Preferred food: first Metal Ingots and then Spoiled Meat

Taming Method - Passive, drop metal ingots (one at a time, it will happily take an entire stack but will not return higher efficiency) until it remains on the ground and allows you to feed it spoiled meat.

A smart and social bird, can be found in groups. Whilst mostly inoffensive there's two things that they love, a nice fresh corpse to chow down on, and anything shiny. The latter can work to a survivors advantage and disadvantage. Dropping a shiny metal ingot in the vicinity of a Corvus will get its attention and be accepted as a gift. After a certain amount of shiny tributes, the Corvus will then remain on the ground and as long as it is undisturbed it will allow you to hand feed to spoiled meat to complete the taming ritual. However, wild Corvus will be maniacally attracted to survivors sporting shiny metal armour or wielding shiny tools and will attack en masse!
