Preferred food: Dino eggs, bigger the better

Similarly to the Titanoboa, the Oviraptor is tamed by feeding it eggs. However, you can tame it with both standard and fertilized eggs. Once tamed, it will eat raw meat like any other carnivore.
Heavier eggs are preferred for taming.

Oviraptors are small, quick, and fragile. Their small size and high speed make them difficult to hit once attacked, so try to get it into a corner before you start firing on it. At lower levels, a Wooden Club may be preferable, and a Bow could potentially kill one in a single shot.

The best way to tame one is to  Bola it first, then either tranq or slingshot it down.
Alternatively, it can be picked up by an  Argentavis or  Pteranodon and moved somewhere safe or shot at by another player.
A tamed  Pulmonoscorpius will be able to trap the Oviraptor by standing above it allowing you to easily knock it out.
If you have a tamed  Equus and a  Lasso, you can use the Lasso to hold the Oviraptor captive and allow another player to knock it out.
