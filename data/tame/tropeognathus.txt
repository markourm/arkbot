Needs Exceptional Kibble
Tropeognathus is tamed non-violently, rather than through the use of tranquilizers. However, in order to trigger a way of feeding the creature, it has to be held in position with a  Chain Bola.
Since it does not attack until it has been provoked the first time, chaining it down in bola will turn it aggressive against the individual.
While its possible to use a  Bola on a Tropeognathus to stop it from flying towards, taming it is impossible as the taming bar will show as "Try the Chain Bola..." while it is entangled with it.
One of the few ways is to set a trap structure with the  Ballista Turret in another end with the Chain Bola, and pull it over towards the trap area.
