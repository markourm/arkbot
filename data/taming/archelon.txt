Preferred food: Bio Toxin, Superior Kibble

The Archelon is unable to be tamed through the standard tranquilize-and-feed methods, and must be tamed non-violently. To feed it, place  Bio Toxin or  Superior Kibble on the last slot of the hotbar, then use the E key.
The Archelon is decently fast in the water, but on land it is incredibly slow. Archelons can spawn near the shores or deep in the depths. In the water, Archelons are susceptible to attacks from  Megalodons and  Mantas, so clearing out any threats before taming is a good idea.

A semi-aquatic mount such as a  Baryonyx or ranged weaponry can prove useful for luring Archelons onto land for safer taming. The shell of an Archelon is able to be walked on, so it is a good spot to stand on and tame them from.
