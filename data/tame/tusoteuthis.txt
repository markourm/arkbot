Preferred food: Black Pearls

The Tusoteuthis introduced two new mechanics to Passive Taming:
It will eat up to 50 of an individual food item in a single consumption. The Taming Affinity (progress) gained for food types other than Black Pearls is only 10% of the value derived by other tames (e.g. 15 from Prime Meat instead of 150), and so at least 10 should be fed at a time to have a comparable taming time to other creatures.

Approach the Tusoteuthis while mounted and allow it to grab your creature.
Dismount then approach the creature's beak with 50 Black Pearls within your last inventory slot. Be aware of the weight of Black Pearls.
Press "Use" to Feed.
Swim directly up and out of the deep-water zone. You are not able to re-mount while the squid has your creature held.
Wait at least 3 minutes, then repeat.
While riderless, the Tusoteuthis will not wait long to let go of your creature - making a team of two the safest option, as the distraction's rider can remain mounted until the creature is fed and then dismount themselves and swim up. If you do attempt to solo tame, flippers are recommended for speedy getaways. Make sure your tame is on passive and set to follow, and if it survives the feeding it will swim up to safety the moment the squid lets go.

The least-likely-to-die distraction available is a high level Carbonemys or Plesjosaurus with a high armor saddle. Another alternative would be to use a Mosasaur (preferably levelled some) with a high armor or Tek saddle on passive. Stimulants may also be required for taming higher level Tusoteuthis, as an unconscious Carbonemys is of no interest to the Tusoteuthis.
