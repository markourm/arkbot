You must be level 85.
You also cannot approach Armaedron on a mount. 
You tame Armaedron is by offering it precious metals and minerals, one piece at a time:
-Metal (least effective)
-Crystal/Obsidian
-Green Gems/Blue Gems
-Red Gems/Silicate
-Black Pearls
-Element Ore (Most effective)

To Initiate the taming process, you must first approach an Armaedron and have it threaten you. When this happens, drop your gift (taming item) on the ground and back up a little. You must make sure to keep your distance. Stay within threatening range but do not draw too close, or the Armaedron will attack. IF you leave too far, it will glitch.
Once Armaedron accepts the gift, it will re-enter its threatening stance. Back off until it stands down.
When you hit 30% taming, the Armaedron will become neutral towards you and you can approach it without threat.

OFFENDED REFUSAL: Armaedron's Cross-Play with Immersive Taming.
As Armaedron is an extremely intelligent creature, it will take offense to being treated like an animal. As such, if offered a bait from immersive taming, Armaedron will enter an immediate rage state and attack. That individual becomes permanently immune to immersive taming and can only be tamed via its usual method. 
Immersive Taming is possible on unoffended armaedron by saving its life from an attacker. DO NOT OFFER IT ANY BAIT. Tame it the standard method until both IT say it is ok to approach, and the Armaedron stops threatening. Continue to do a mixture of petting and gift-giving until Armaedron can be hand-fed. When that becomes an option, it is safe to feed armaedron baits using hand-feeding only.
