Preferred food: Regular Kibble, Vegetables, Mejoberry

Non-combat tame. 
To feed one you will need to be level 30, place taming food in the last slot of your hotbar and sneak close enough to be able to feed it. Gigantopithecus will take one piece of food and you will need to wait till it goes hungry again. If you come into physical contact with Gigantopithecus the creature will attack. You must get out of its line of sight in order for it to calm back down and be feed-able again. Your taming progress will not be reset if the creature attacks you, but you will lose taming effectiveness if you fight back.

Another method is to trap the Gigantopithecus in a 1x1 room with no roof or a hatchframe. You can then feed it from above without having to worry about bumping into it or having it wander off, and wild carnivores will have a tougher time getting to it.
