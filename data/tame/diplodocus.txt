Diplodocus is able to be both traditionally knockout tamed or passive tamed. If you attract its attention, it will try to push you away, which deals no direct damage (indirectly: fall damage or being pushed into hostile creatures).

There is no need to take any exact caution with the Diplodocus in terms of passive taming. Even if "aggro'd", granted its vocalization when it notices the player and the voices it makes when "attacking", it is simply trying to be friendly, by nudging the player. 

Standing under it, just behind its front legs will cause it to try and hit you continually, without actually managing it, making it completely stationary and unable to move you. Easy for non-violent tame. However, it should be noted that the time interval between the first and second feeding is very long while every other time is much shorter.
