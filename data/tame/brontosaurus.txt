Herbivore. Minimum level requirement 63

Best taming food is kibble. Other taming food from best to worst: Botany bale bait, veggie bag bait, berry bag bait. Baits can be crafted at the bait station.

Put taming food into your last quickslot (0) and use it to drop it on the ground near the dino. After a while you can feed the dino from hand.

Occasionally the dino wants you to pet them. The reaction changes depending on the taming %
0 - 25% - the dino is startled and may run away
25% and above - the dino enjoys petting
55%  - the dino will want to be cared every now and again

Taming will also progress when you fight against other nearby dinos from different species, but be careful not to harm the one you are taming.
