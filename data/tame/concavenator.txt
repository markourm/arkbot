Concavenator are naturally immune to traditional methods of torpor. In order to knockout a Concavenator, you must use explosives while they are in a digging state (C4 is recommended). Doing so will cause them to violently rupture from the ground, and flee briefly before attempting to continue their attack. Each explosive that deals damage to them while they're digging causes torpor. Enough explosives and they will become knocked out. Their torpor recovers pretty quickly, so make sure you have narcotics! Concavenator use Allo food preferences (raw mutton, cooked mutton, raw prime meat, cooked prime meat, raw meat, cooked meat).
