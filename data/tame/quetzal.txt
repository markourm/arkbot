Carnivore. A quetzal almost never lands.
Best taming food is kibble. Other taming food from best to worst: raw mutton bait, raw meat bait, raw prime fish bait, raw fish bait. Baits can be crafted at the bait station.

You will also need balloons which can also be crafted at the bait station and a flying mount where you can drop off baits (griffin if you are alone, if you are with two people - passenger seat of a tapejara or in the claws of an argentavis)

Put the balloons in your quickslot number (9) and taming food into your last quickslot (0) and use it to drop it floating in the air near the dino. After a while you can feed the dino from hand.

Occasionally the dino wants you to pet them. The reaction changes depending on the taming %
0 - 25% - the dino is startled and may run away
25% and above - the dino enjoys petting
55%  - the dino will want to be cared every now and again

Taming will also progress when you fight against other nearby dinos from different species, but be careful not to harm the one you are taming.
