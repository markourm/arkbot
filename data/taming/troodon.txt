Preferred food: baby dinos, bigger the better

Troodons use a unique flavour of Passive Taming. Instead of putting a Food item in your last Inventory Slot, you have to instead allow the Troodon to kill your tames. Troodons gain Taming Affinity by earning Combat Experience, with the amount required reduced by 40% at night. Taming Affinity will only be credited to a player if the creature killed belonged to you or your tribe. Creatures must not be set as Passive and must be unmounted by a player.
Creatures can be unconscious or pre-damaged (i.e. at 1 Health remaining). Babies and adults provide the same amount of experience.
Troodons will not readily aggro onto most creatures that provide a substantial amount of experience. 

Baby Wyverns are the most recommended taming method as Wyvern Eggs are readily available and the babies do not starve at an accelerated rate.Using Cryopods to inflict Cryo Sickness on the creature you are trying to sacrifice will cause it to take 10x the damage. This can make it much faster and easier for the Troodon to kill them.
