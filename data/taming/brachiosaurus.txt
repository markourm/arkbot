Brachiosaurus can be tamed with immersive combat taming or with vanilla knockout taming.

The vanilla knockout method is somewhat unique. Brachiosaurus is naturally immune to torpor damage, and CANNOT be traditionally knocked out. In order to tame a Brachiosaurus, survivors must first provoke a Brachiosaurus, and keep its aggression until it begins to switch to a bipedal stance. Once Brachiosaurus is standing, DO NOT GET NEAR IT. Brachiosaurus will perform its Mega Stomp if you tread too close, so be careful! While maintaining your distance, survivors must damage its hind legs with firearms, aiming for the knees and shins of the creature. Once Brachiosaurus suffers enough damage it will collapse and go unconscious, allowing for players to feed and tame!
