The Gacha is not tamed by traditional means, but rather food and items must be dropped in front of it, he eats everything you drop!

You will have to time the drop of the item to get it into the path of the gacha and you can drop a stack as the gacha will pick up the whole stack and eat them continuously until tamed or out of the item. Watch their food meter when traveling long distances and supply it manually.
