You must be level 85.
You also cannot approach Armaedron on a mount. Armaedron will take approaching it on a mount as a threat or act of violence, and will retaliate with immediate aggression.
In a nutshell, how you tame Armaedron is by offering it precious metals and minerals until you finally befriend it after earning its trust.
From least effective to most effective, here are the items you can give Armaedron to tame:
-Metal (least effective)
-Crystal/Obsidian
-Green Gems/Blue Gems
-Red Gems/Silicate
-Black Pearls
-Element Ore (Most effective)

To Initiate the taming process, you must first approach an Armaedron and have it threaten you. When this happens, drop your gift (taming item) on the ground and back up a little.
You will notice Armaedron becomes curious in what you drop and will proceed to walk towards it.
Here's the important part: you must make sure to keep your distance. Stay within threatening range but do not draw too close, or the Armaedron will attack.
Keep a good middle distance and do not leave the threatening distance or the Armaedron will glitch during its next step.
Once Armaedron accepts the gift, it will re-enter its threatening stance. Once you receive the message that re-starts the the threatening process, let the Armaedron have its personal space, and back off until it stands down.
The amount of the item you drop does NOT affect taming affinity. Giving it 1,000 or so black pearls in a stack will give you the same affinity as giving it a single one.

After waiting a bit, repeat the process. Approach Armaedron, let it threaten you. Drop the gift and maintain your careful distance.
Wait for him to accept the gift, threaten again, then back off until he stands down. Keep doing this until you hit 30% affinity.
When you hit 30% taming, the Armaedron will become neutral towards you and you can approach it without threat.
You will gain a buff called "Friend of the Red Dragon", which will prevent Armaedron from attacking you when you approach.
