Level requirement 80
Cryolophosaurus are naturally immune to traditional methods of torpor and taming. To tame a Cryolophosaurus, the player must shoot at a Cryo's mouth or throat while it's using its' freezing breath. Causing enough damage while a Cryo is performing this action will cause the liquid in their throat to backfire, freezing the Cryo for a brief time! While frozen, the player must quickly approach the Cryo and feed them their favorite foods. Quickly back off, and repeat these steps until the Cryo is tamed! Cryolophosaurus use Yutyrannus food preferences (raw mutton, cooked mutton, raw prime meat, cooked prime meat, raw meat, cooked meat).
