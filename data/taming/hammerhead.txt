Preferred food: Whale Lice

Vicious, deadly, voracious pack hunters, the rest of the ocean is lucky that this particular species of shark has developed such a liking to the Lice that infest the bodies of Maiabalaena that they pretty much have no interest in anything other than defending their chosen whale and dining all day on a mobile limitless feast. Hammerheads subsist entirely on Whale Lice, so to keep tamed ones going you'll either have to have a tamed Maiabalaena or two around to harvest Lice from, or be prepared to make regular trips into the ocean to harvest wild ones. On the upside they get lots of food per Lice, and it is very good for healing them.
