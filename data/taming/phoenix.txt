The Phoenix is only found on the Scorched Earth map during a Heat Wave weather event.

The Phoenix must be struck with flaming weapons in order to tame. This includes the Flamethrower, Flaming Arrows and Fire Wyvern breath. When struck by fire, the taming bar will increase minutely. It takes a long time, and If the process is not completed before the Heat Wave ends the Phoenix will disintegrate into a pile of ashes. The Phoenix will spawn from the same ash pile at the start of the next Heat Wave.

Hitting a flying Phoenix with a  Flame Arrow is rather hard, and they are by far the least effective in taming progress. The arrows themselves do impact damage while the flames do not. However damaging the Phoenix during taming won't hurt the effectiveness of the tame. Flying after a Phoenix and drenching it in fire with the  Flamethrower is effective; though you will need a lot of gas and 2 or 3 flamethrowers to complete a high level tame.

Perhaps one of the most efficient, and fastest method of taming a Phoenix is to search for it and follow it with a high stamina  Fire Wyvern. The Fire Wyverns breath has the most effect for taming progress compared to all the other methods. This method can be made even easier by using a built trap, another Fire Wyvern,(preferably of the opposite sex, as the mate boost increases the breath damage), a survivor held in the Wyvern's claws equipped with a flamethrower if flying, using oil jars in addition, or by combining all of the above options for maximum taming prowess.

Oil Jars can be used to tame the Phoenix if you know where their Ashes areMark the spot exactly where the Phoenix's ashes lay and bring the Oil Jars with either some Fire arrows or Flamethrower to start a fire. Building materials are also required to create a trap to keep the Phoenix in one place. Once the Phoenix arises again from the ashes, break the jar right under it, and light it on fire. It always respawns at it's last location.
