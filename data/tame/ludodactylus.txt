Preferred Taming Foods:
1. Fertilised Wyvern/Drake/Magmasaur eggs,
2. Yuty Eggs,
3. Fertilised Deinonychus Eggs, then Extra Large, Large, Medium, Small, Extra Small Eggs in that order. Golden Hesperornis eggs cannot be used.

To tame a Ludo, equip an egg in your 0 slot in your hotbar as for normal passive tames, however, the opportunity will only arise for you to feed it if the Ludo grabs you and carries you upwards.
You will want to take something to soak the damage, either be riding a tanky tame or have a shield and good armour at the ready.
When it grabs you you'll be able to feed it the egg, it will then lose interest in you for a short amount of time, which is somewhat unfortunate as it will then drop you and let you fall to your doom, so make sure to have parachutes or an Archaeopterx.
Rinse and repeat until it tamed.
