In the wild you can harvest Lice from a living whale by swimming up to one and pressing E in the same manner as you would get fish from a Leeds. However each whale has a retinue of Sharks and Penguins following it and living off of the lice that you are about to take. The way to tame a Maiabaleena is to cure it of its infestation, using Louse Antidote which is crafted in the inventory of penguins using Lice, Oil, Biotoxin, a Penguin Egg and Citronal. This is a variety of passive taming, you must have Louse Antidote in your 0 Slot, harvest Lice from the whale, and you will then have a 30 second window in which to administer the antidote. Beware though as giving a dose of antidote will attract Sharks and make them come to protect the Whale. Simply rinse and repeat until tamed.

As filter feeders, Maiabalaena have no food stat. They never need to be fed, however just because you have rid them of their lice infestation once, the little bleeders can return and infect the whale again. When riding you'll see the buff meter (Giga rage meter) keep an eye on that because if it completely fills up your whale will become feral, it will get set to aggressive and wandering, will be unable to be ridden, and will not obey orders until it gets treated once more with a Louse Antidote. It takes roughly 24 real time hours for an infestation to completely take over, so you'll need to treat your whale with antidote at least once a day, either by having it in Slot 0 and then selecting from the radial menu, or by force feeding in the inventory. Note that if a whale does go feral, it will still respect any following orders it already has, so if you don't think you'll be able to get on, put it to follow something to stop it buggering off completely.
