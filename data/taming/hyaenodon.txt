You do not use any type of food to tame the Hyaenodon. The game will prompt you to pet it every 30 seconds while crouching. However, it must be far enough from the leader in order to receive this prompt. Be sure to stay on top of this, the taming percentage will drop very quickly if you fail to pet within the following seconds.

You can create a taming cage using foundations and ceilings. You use the foundations to anchor the ceilings and make a hollow box in the center. Next add some walls and a ramp to make a more conventional taming trap. Lure the Hyaenodon into the trap and then you can crawl under the ceiling and pet it from there, making it far less likely to detect you.

Ghillie Armor is recommended. Once tamed the Hyaenodon will eat raw meat like any other carnivore.
