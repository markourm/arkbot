Preferred food: Basic Kibble, Vegetables, Mejoberry, Berries

Mesopithecus is tamed non-violently. Put the food you wish to feed it with in the far-right slot of your hotbar. Then, approach Mesopithecus and press the use key to feed it when the button prompt appears. Do not get any closer than necessary for the prompt to appear, or Mesopithecus will get scared and run away. (It helps to crouch, and to a lesser extent wear a Ghillie Suit.) Be mindful of its health bar whilst taming, every time the Mesopithecus becomes startled it will lose a small fraction of its health, scare it too many times and it will die.

If too much time is spent between feedings then the taming bar will decrease slowly, so Kibble is more effective and allows you to make up for progress lost while defending against predators or trying to find the creature after it has run away.
