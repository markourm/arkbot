Preferred food: Simple Kibble, Rare Flower, Raw Mutton

The Giant Bee is a passive tame. You have to crack open the hive to get to the queen, then feed it  Simple Kibble or  Rare Flower. She will also eat Raw and Cooked Mutton.

Some hives are empty though. If the hive is occupied, a swarm of Giant Bees will come out and attack the person who damaged it. You can check without damaging the hive, however, by staying near it and listening for the sounds the queen makes, as she can be heard beating her wings and occasionally buzzing from inside. Only occupied hives have a Queen - empty ones just have some honey to harvest every 15 minutes.

Use a dino or shoot the nest until it breaks. You can also build a Wooden Pillar under the hive and place a C4 Charge on top of the pillar to take the hive out in a single blast without having to worry about getting stung. The Queen will slowly descend towards the ground where you can begin taming. You can use a  Quetzal or another flying mount, but be warned, if it gets stung you will get dismounted. A Quetzal with a Platform Saddle is the best option due to its high AOE (area of effect), and you won't be thrown far if you're dismounted. Try not to accidentally kill the queen. Sometimes the queen gets stuck in the tree and will not move from where her hive was destroyed.

Once the hive is broken and the queen exposed, use a  Ghillie Suit to prevent stings, as well as  Bug Repellant to get close enough. Feeding your dino Bug Repellant does work in combination with your repellant. This allows you to get close enough without angering the drones. However, if you get too close or touch the queen, the drones will become angry and attack regardless.

Sometimes it is possible to get more than one Queen from the wild hive.
