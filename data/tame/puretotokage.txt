Survivors or Hunters wishing to domesticate puretotokage have two options. Tame the stubborn beast passively with kibble, or wrangle it unconscious. However, its armor and natural caustic fumes prevent it from falling to narcotic tranquilizers. It can be rendered unconscious via concussive force to the head. Knockout tame like with Rock Golems with this mod's Concussive Arrows instead of cannons: as the Concussive arrows only hit once. This means you cant accidentally hit the creature again as you knock it out, reducing effectiveness.
Be careful trapping Puretotokage to knock it out. It'll start utilizing its explosive attacks to break out if you do!

Can be passive tamed at lvl 55: but only with kibble.
