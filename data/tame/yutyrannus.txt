Carnivore. 
Best taming food is kibble. Other taming food from best to worst: raw mutton bait, raw meat bait, raw prime fish bait, raw fish bait. Baits can be crafted at the bait station.

Attach a yuty lung trophy bait to an arrow and shoot it close to the dino. Trophy baits can be crafted at the trophy bait station. After picking it up, the dino challenges you to a combat. You must get close to them and fight in melee. You may use your mount. The dino must have a chance to fight back or they will deem your fighting cowardly and the taming will not progress. Once the taming reaches 25% the dino is no longer aggressive and it is time to stop fighting.

Put taming food into your last quickslot (0) and use it to drop it on the ground near the dino. After a while you can feed the dino from hand.

Occasionally the dino wants you to pet them. The reaction changes depending on the taming %
0 - 25% - the dino is startled and may run away
25% and above - the dino enjoys petting
55%  - the dino will want to be cared every now and again

Taming will also progress when you fight against other nearby dinos from different species, but be careful not to harm the one you are taming.
