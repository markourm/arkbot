The Basilosaurus is a passive tame. You need to first kill all mantas which are following it and then swim to its mouth and feed it Exceptional kibble or meat from your last item slot.
Due to its constant wandering in the water along with the ocean's many threats it is highly advised to be in SCUBA gear and owning a strong tame such as a high level Megalodon at hand before attempting to tame. After their initial bite there will be a long grace period before eating again due to its very high food stat. However once it can be fed again it will be ready to eat within ~10 seconds for non-kibble foods. Keep lots of prime meat at hand and to keep your eyes peeled for any predators that are drawn to the Basilosaurus during the taming process.
