Preferred food: Simple Kibble, Rockarrot, vegetables, sweet vegetable cake, mejoberry, berries

Begin by sneaking up on the Unicorn - they will flee if you startle them, much like the Tapejara. A ghillie suit will greatly aid in this endeavor. Place its preferred food in the last slot of your action bar, and when close enough, press E to feed. You are then able to press E again to mount the Unicorn. It will begin to run with you on its back, so be aware of any potential threats in the area prior to beginning the tame. While riding, watch for when it begins to buck and attempt to throw you off. Press E again to feed and calm the Unicorn. If you do not hit the feed button fast enough you will be thrown off the Unicorn, which will then kick you to inflict torpor damage. Repeat this process until you have your very own noble steed. Make sure to only feed the Unicorn when it starts bucking. If you feed it prior, then it will throw you off itâ€™s back and your taming progress will be lowered. You may jump while riding the Unicorn, so you may do this until it runs out of stamina, effectively making it slower. While taming, you must be defensive against other creatures, so go in prepared. Have other tames and tribe members on aggressive and follow, and it may also be worth walling off the area that the Unicorn is in (in an effort to minimize the predators in the area). Sometimes if another creature hits the Unicorn during taming, the taming progress drops to 0%, and taming efficiency is penalized as well.

Another good strategy is to pick up the Unicorn with an  Argentavis or Quetzal and drop it in a trap, as the regions they spawn in are relatively dangerous.

Every time you botch the taming process you will lose taming effectiveness. It is possible to reset the effectiveness to 100% by knocking the Unicorn unconscious - however they might despawn at some point after - this even while taming it.
