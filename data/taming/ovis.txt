Preferred food: Sweet Vegetable Cake

The Ovis is a passive tame; all one has to do is walk up to it and feed it Sweet Vegetable Cake. While the Ovis itself presents no real threat, native predators such as  Raptor,  Carnotaurus,  Sabertooth and  Tyrannosaurus can provide a threat to both the player and the Ovis.
