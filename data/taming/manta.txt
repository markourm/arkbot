Preferred food: Angler Gel

The Manta is tamed passively. Manta is a hostile creature which makes this tame very frustrating and, due to the Manta's high damage output, even dangerous. Mantas are tamed using  Angler Gel, which is dropped by the  Angler.
Mantas won't aggro when you are on an Ichthy so it's easy and safe to get close by to feed them and follow them in between the feedings.

Bug Repellant works against their aggro radius. Use an amphibious mount to lure them into very shallow water (so they can't go up or down), jump on land, apply Bug Repellant on yourself, put on your scuba fins and approach the manta from the rear. 

Stone Doorframe trapping is very efficient if you want to tame a Manta solo. Build a Stone Foundation on a flat part in the water somewhere not too close to the shore. Place three stone doorframes around the perimeter, leave one empty slot. Aggro a Manta and lure it to your structure. Swim in through the open slot and swim out the stone doorframe opposite to it so that the Manta will get stuck. After this, slowly swim towards it so you can place the final stone doorframe behind it to ultimately trap it. Be careful though, if you get too close to the open stone doorframe the Manta might be able to hit you!
