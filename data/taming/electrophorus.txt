Preferred food: Bio Toxin, Raw Mutton, Raw Prime Meat

Passive tame, it is very aggressive with a wide aggro radius. Stay clear if not prepared.
Riot Armor / high fortitude for Torpor reduction recommended.
High oxygen to chase them down and feed them bait/taming feed.
Mount Basilosaurus and allow the Electrophorus to shock your creature, while mounted. The Basilo will not take any damage and its movement will not be impaired. While the Electrophorus is recharging its electrical attack, quickly dismount your Basilo and passively feed your attempted tame. Remount, rinse and repeat.
It is possible, but difficult to tame Electrophorus one-on-one without using a trap. Clear out any threats nearby; Have at least bio toxin ready, and lure one out into shallow water. From there, it is a matter of time and caution. Make sure to bring either health tonics or blood packs along with stimulants for a quick recovery between feeding attempts.
